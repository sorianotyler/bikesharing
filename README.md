## Overview of Project
 The objective of this project is to perform a statistical analysis on the usage of Citibikes in NYC to see if it would be a suitable business model in Des Moines. Our goal is to uncover as much information as possible.   
### Purpose
    The purpose of this challenge is to use tableau to tell a story through our data, focusing on a consistent story for our investors.

## Summary 
- In summary, we see that the Citibikes in New York are used by all genders for a quick mode of transportation to get to and from work and a way to navigate the city on the weekends. Most of the rides on citibikes were around 5 mintues with the majority being well under 1 hour. For more information I would suggest we find how many users in Manhattan are subscribers or how many users coming out of top used stations are subscribers. This would show if tourism plays a big part in the success of the business model. I would also try to visualize the trip duration by weekday and location. From this we will see if users are riding the bikes for longer if they have more free time or if riding these bikes is just a convenient mode of transportation and if that will translate to Des Moines.
